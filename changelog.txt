VERSION[1.1.0][2016/09/19]
 * You can now import all character data: passive tree, jewels, skills and items!
    * Character import now has two options:
       * Passive Tree and Jewels: imports the passive skill tree and any jewels socketed into it
	   * Items and Skills: imports all other equipped items, and any skills socketed into them
    * When importing to an existing build:
       * The passive tree will be replaced with the imported one
       * Items (including jewels) will be added to the build, unless the item was added by a previous character import
	      * If you've previously added an item by copying it from ingame, the character import will still add it,
	        so you'll need to delete the old items after the import
	   * Skills will be added if no existing skill matches the new one ('match' meaning the same gems in the same order)
    * The only data that cannot be imported is the bandit choices, as these aren't available from the API
 * Several improvements have been made to the Skills system:
    * You can now specify multiple active gems in a single skill setup (now referred to as a socket group)
    * Hovering over an active gem will highlight the support gems which are applying to it,
	  and hovering over a support gem will highlight the active gems that it applies to
	* The skills system should now be much more accurate at determining which supports can apply to active skill gems
    * Support gems granted by an item are now automatically applied to any skills socketed in that item
       * Any such supports that you've added manually will be ignored due to the next change:
    * Multiple copies of support gems are now handled correctly (only the gem with the highest level is used)
 * Modifiers that depend on the absence of enemy status effects should now only apply in effective DPS mode
 * Passive tree search now highlights using a red circle instead of flashing

    * If there's two slots the item can go in, holding Shift as well will equip it in the second slot instead
    * Jewels cannot be equipped in this way (since it'll probably put them in the wrong socket) but they will 
      still be added to your build if you Ctrl-Click them in the uniques or templates lists
